(Bitcoin uses double hashing almost everywhere it hashes in one of two variants)[https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/8443/where-is-double-hashing-performed-in-bitcoin]:
*  Hash160이라 불리는  RIPEMD160(SHA256(x)) 는 160bit의 출력을 낸다
    * 비트코인 주소를 생성하기 위해 퍼블릭 키를 해싱한다.
*  Hash256 이라 불리는  SHA256(SHA256(x)) 은 256bit의 출력을 낸다.
    * 비트코인 주소에서 checksum을 생성
    * 머클트리의 블록을 해싱
    * 트랜젝션의 출력과 입력을 연결
    * 블록헤더를 해싱, 그러므로 작업증명 및 지난 블록을 연결
It seems like Satoshi chose Hash256 whenever collisions are a problem, and Hash160 when only (multi target) second pre-images matter. This is consistent with a goal of achieving 128 bits of security.
You need a 2*n bit hash to achieve n bit collision resistance, and you need a t*n bit hash to achieve n bit second pre-image resistance. If we assume a conservative 4 billion targets, and a 128 bit security level, this leads to 256 bit hashes for collision resistance and 160 bit hashes for multi-target second-preimages.

(Tech explained: Hash puzzles and proofs of work)[https://3583bytesready.net/2016/09/06/hash-puzzes-proofs-work-bitcoin/]


Following my blockchain Computerworld article, I’ve been getting quite a few questions about how the Bitcoin blockchain is protected by ‘difficulty’.  Mining blocks is hard, so, what are miners doing that uses so much time, effort and power? They’re proving their work, by solving hash-puzzles.

Bitcoin uses the transaction data, and ‘chains’ the previous block’s hash value as a starting input for the next block’s. Miners then race to tack on massive random numbers until they find one that produces a hash that matches a specific pattern with a certain level of difficulty.
The blockchain is protected from modification because the hash-puzzle takes (on average) about a one-hundred-billion-billion attempts to find — it’s more work the any individual is capable of producing. But, the miners work in parallel competing to solve the next puzzle — thousands of miners, rolling the hash-puzzle-dice, over a million-million-million times per second.
Hash-puzzles are an elegant solution that provides security to the Bitcoin blockchain.
